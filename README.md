## Project Structure
The project follows the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack for building the Remake movie guessing game.

The `client` folder contains the frontend code built with React. 

The `server` folder contains the backend code built with Node.js and Express. This includes the API endpoints, database connections, and business logic required to handle requests from the client and perform server-side operations. 

The MongoDB database is used to store movies data and user statistics. The database stores information about the movies available for guessing, user details, scores, and other relevant statistics.
